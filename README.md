# TrafficSimulationModel-CTM
A Python implementation for simulating traffic flow on networks.

This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook for implementing the famous Cell Transmission Model (CTM) for simulating traffic on networks. The model can be used to assess the state of the network including travel times or network delays on various parts of the network given traffic information along network boundaries.
